## Process (Software)

- **CPU**

  - Usage over time
- **Memory**
  - Current usage
  - Usage over time
- **File I/O**
  - Total file reads
  - Total file writes

## Host and Devices

- Host may use multiple devices.
- Some devices are file-based; RAM-based devices store data in memory.
- Metrics can be collected at the host or device level.

## Performance Considerations

- Logging metrics should not impact performance.
- Collect system and process metrics periodically.
